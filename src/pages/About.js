        <p className="lead-text">
          Based in Kenya, I blend software engineering and graphic design to build meaningful digital products. From clean code to visual storytelling, I specialize in crafting solutions that are both functional and visually impactful. Whether designing in Adobe Photoshop or building full-stack apps with the MERN or PERN stack, I approach each project with precision, creativity, and purpose.

            <p>
              "Design is how it feels. Code is how it works. My philosophy sits at the sweet spot â€” merging emotional connection with technical execution. I believe in designing with empathy and developing with scalability in mind. Every pixel and every line of code should solve a problem, tell a story, or spark a smile."
